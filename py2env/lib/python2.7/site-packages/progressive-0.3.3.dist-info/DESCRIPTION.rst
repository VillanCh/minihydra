**Alpha Warning! Until `1.0.0`, `progressive` will likely be going under some kind of radical API revision every minor release; just a forewarning.**

## Installation

* For the possibly stable

```
pip install progressive
```

* For the latest and greatest

```
git clone https://github.com/hfaran/progressive.git
cd progressive
python setup.py install
```

## Getting Started

* There is preliminary documentation is available at [readthedocs](http://progressive.readthedocs.org/) but more detailed documentation is coming soon on completion of the 1.0 API, but in the meantime check out the [examples](https://github.com/hfaran/progressive/blob/master/progressive/examples.py).
* `progressive` supports graceful fallback modes for terminals without colors, [but you really should upgrade your terminal to 256 colors](http://pastelinux.wordpress.com/2010/12/01/upgrading-linux-terminal-to-256-colors/) to make full use of `progressive`.
